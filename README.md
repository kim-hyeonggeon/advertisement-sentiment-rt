# Reddit Advertisement Sentiment Analysis

## Executive Summary (For Hiring Managers)

In this experiment, I tested whether AI-written ads outperform human-written ads in driving engagement. AI-generated neutral ads achieved a 34% lift in CTR and recruited users who were significantly more likely to complete the survey. However, performance varied by tone, demonstrating the importance of message positioning in paid media strategy.

## Business Question
**Do AI-generated ads outperform human-written ads in attracting and retaining users?**
Rather than just measuring clicks, this project evaluates the full conversion funnel: Impressions → Clicks → Survey Starts → Survey Completion

## Experimental Design
- Multi-variant A/B test (Neutral, Emotional, Professional tone)
- 25k+ impressions per variant
- Randomized delivery via Reddit Ads Manager
- Power analysis conducted prior to launch
**Metrics evaluated:**
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Completion rate
- Drop-off behavior

## Key Results
- AI Neutral ads increased CTR from 1.50% → 2.01% (~34% lift)
- AI-recruited users completed surveys at 97% vs. 83%
- Tone significantly impacted performance - AI did not universally outperform human copy
